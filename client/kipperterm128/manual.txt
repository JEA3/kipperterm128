               HELLO THERE, WELCOME TO KIPPERTERM 128.
      THIS PROGRAM IS RELEASED AS DONATION-WARE, IF YOU FIND IT USEFUL, FEEL    FREE TO SEND A DONATION TO MY PAYPAL ACCOUNT SEANPECK@HOTMAIL.COM, PLEASE MAKE  SURE YOU SEND A COMMENT FOR WHAT ITS FOR, SO I CAN PROPERLY THANK YOU.  IF YOU  DONATE $25 OR MORE I AM EVEN WILLING TO OLD SCHOOL YOU AN ACTUAL 5.25 FLOPPY IN THE MAIL (US & CANADA ONLY) WITH THE SOFTWARE ON IT IF YOU LIKE (OBVIOUSLY MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE YOUR ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND IT OUT TO YOU).  I ASSURE YOU THAT BANY DONATIONS WILL BE APPRECIATED, AND WILL MOST LIKELY BE USED TO FOR BUYING   MYSELF A BEER OR TWO FOR A JOB WELL DONE, OR FOR ACQUIRING OTHER COMMODORE      RETRO EQUIPMENT THAT I WILL LIKELY WRITE SOFTWARE FOR IF I FIND THE TIME. 
      THIS PROJECT WAS BORN SIMPLY BY THE FACT THAT APPARENTLY NO ONE HAS       BOTHERED TO WRITE A NIC TERMINAL PROGRAM FOR THE GLORIOUS COMMODORE 128.        THIS OF COURSE, I COULD NOT ALLOW TO STAND. THE C64 IS A GREAT MACHINE,         AND I SPENT MANY AN HOUR IN FRONT OF IT IN MY YOUTH, THE C128 HOWEVER IS INDEED FAR SUPERIOR, IF SADLY LESS LOVED.  
    AS ANY OLD TIMER COULD HAVE TOLD YOU BACK IN THE DAY THE TERMINAL PROGRAMS  AVAILABLE FOR THE 128, WITH ITS 80 COLUMN MODE WERE VAST IMPROVEMENTS OVER      THEIR 64 COUNTERPARTS... NOTHING AGAINST NOVATERM IT WAS A GREAT PROGRAM,       BUT YOU CAN ONLY GET SO MUCH OUT OF THE 64, AND 40 COLUMNS, IS JUST WAY TOO     LIMITING... EVEN WITH THE 80 COLUMN HI RES 4 BIT WIDE BY 8 BIT HIGH HACK        MAKING 80 COLUMNS AT LEAST POSSIBLE ON THE 64, IT REALLY WAS NO SUBSTITUTE      FOR THE VDC.
    WITH ALL THAT SAID, THIS PROJECT IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO GET A TERMINAL     OUT THERE FOR THOSE OF US WHO LOVE THE OLD 128.  ITS IS IN ITS 1.0 VERSION      NOTHING MORE THAN A PURE PORT OF THE KIPPERTERM2 CODE BASE TO RUN ON THE        128 IN 80 COLUMNS.  ITS' USER INTERFACE AS SUCH WILL SEEM A LITTLE KLUDGY       COMPARED TO MOST 128 PROGRAMS AS I DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING.
    WHEN CONNECTING TO A REMOTE SYSTEM  YOU WILL HAVE 3 PROMPTS TO ANSWER
THE FIRST IS THE HOSTNAME, ENTER THE HOST NAME OR REMOTE IP YOU WISH TO CONNECT TO. THE SECOND IS THE PORT, ENTER THE PORT OF THE REMOTE SYSTEM YOU WISH TO     CONNECT TO, IF NO PORT IS GIVEN THE SYSTEM DEFAULTS TO 23 THE DEFAULT TELENT    PORT. 
    THE FINAL QUESTION IS WHICH MODE DO YOU WISH TO CONNECT WITH, VT100, ANSI   OR PETSCII. IF YOU ARE CONNECTING TO A BBS RUN ON A COMMODORE 64 OR 128 THAT    SUPPORTS THE COMMODORE NATIVE CHARACTER SET YOU WILL WANT TO USE PETSCII        (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS C/G OR COMMODORE GRAPHICS.)
    THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REMAINING MODES, VT100 AND ANSI, ARE WHICH     CHARACTER SET THE TERMINAL WILL USE. IF YOU CHOOSE VT100 THE STANDARD ASCII     CHARACTER SET WILL BE USED, THIS WOULD BE RECOMMENDED WHEN CONNECTING TO A UNIX SERVER OR BBS THAT IS NOT USING THE CUSTOM IBM EXTENDED ASCII SET. MOST IBM BBS SYSTEMS HOWEVER ARE DESIGNED AROUND THE IBM EXTENDED ASCII CHARACTER SET        (CP437)SO IF YOU ARE CONNECTING TO AN IBM BBS YOU PROBABLY WILL WANT TO CHOOSE  ANSI MODE. IN ANSI MODE THE NATIVE COMMODORE CHARACTER SET IS USED, BUT IS      MAPPED AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE EQUIVALENT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE IBM      CP437 CHARACTERSET. THE MAPPING IS NOT PERFECT, BUT IT DOES A REASONABLE        REPRESENTATION MAKING THESE BBS AND THEIR FEATURES VERY USABLE.
    IF THIS ALL SEEMS CONFUSING TO YOU, THE SIMPLE RULE OF THUMB WOULD BE IF    THE BBS DOES NOT SUPPORT COMMODORE GRAPHICS, TRY CONNECTING TO IT WITH ONE MODE AND IF THINGS LOOK WONKY CALL BACK AND TRY THE OTHER MODE.     

BASIC COMMANDS:
HELP KEY: 
SHOW THE HELP MENU 
RUN/STOP: 
THIS KEY IS THE KIND OF ALL PURPOSE GO BACK/DONE KEY. 
PRESSING THIS KEY WHILE CONNECTED IN TELNET MODE WILL INSTANTLY END THE         CONNECTION AND PROMPT YOU FOR NEW HOSTNAME.
PRESSING THIS KEY IN GOPHER MODE WILL RETURN YOU TO THE MAIN MENU
PRESSING THIS KEY WHILE IN THE ADDRESS BOOK WILL RETURN YOU TO THE MAIN MENU.
TERMINAL MODE:
WHEN CONNECT IN TERMINAL MODE, AND YOU WISH TO OPEN THE SUBMENU TO UPLOAD,      DOWNLOAD OR SEND A SPECIFIC ASCII CHARACTER BY ITS NUMBERIC VALUE, YOU WILL     NEED TO HIT THE F1 KEY TO BRING UP THE SUB MENU.
HITTING RETURN AT THE PROMPT FOR A HOSTNAME WITHOUT ENTERING ANYTHING WILL      RETURN YOU TO THE MAIN MENU.
IF YOU OPENED A TELNET CONNECTION VIA THE ADDRESS BOOK, WHEN THAT SESSION IS    CLOSED YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO THE ADDRESS BOOK, TO EXIT BACK TO THE MAIN       MENU YOU MUST HIT THE RUN/STOP KEY.
BUFFER COMMANDS:
    KIPPETERM 128 HAS A ROUGHLY 63K BUFFER ALLOWING YOU TO CAPTURE AND VIEW     DATA. ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS VERY RUDIMENTARY BASICALLY DISPLAYING A PAGE OF     DATA AT A TIME, PROMPTING THE USER TO PRESS ANY KEY TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE,   WHEN ALL THE DATA IN THE BUFFER HAS BEEN DISPLAYED IT WILL PROMPT THE USER TO   ALSO PRESS A KEY AND RETURN BACK TO THE TERMINAL MODE OR MAIN MENU DEPENDING    ON WHERE THEY INITIATED THE VIEW BUFFER COMMAND FROM. IF A USER WISHES TO EXIT  VIEWING THE BUFFER PRIOR TO VIEWING IT ALL THEY SHOULD PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY     WHEN PROMPTED TO PRESS ANY KEY AND THIS WILL IMMEDIATELY CLOSE THE BUFFER VIEW  MODE.
    THE STATUS OF THE BUFFER IS VISUALLY DIPLAYED IN THE STATUS BAR (BOTTOM     LINE ON THE SCREEN). YOU WILL SEE A CAPITAL B IN THE STATUS BAR WHEN THE        TERMINAL IS ACTIVELY BUFFERING AND IT WILL NOT BE VISIBLE WHEN BUFFERING HAS    BEEN TURNED OFF. WHEN THE BUFFER IS FULL IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY TURN ITSELF OFF, AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TURN IT BACK ON UNTIL YOU CLEAR THE BUFFER.
(COMMANDS WORK ON THE MAIN MENU AND WHEN CONNECTED TO A REMOTE SITE)
C= B TOGGLES BUFFER ON AND OFF 
C= V VIEWS THE BUFFER 
C= P PRINTS THE BUFFER - THIS WILL OUTPUT THE CONTENTS OF THE BUFFER TO YOUR         PRINTER, YOU CAN HIT THE ESCAPE KEY DURING PRINTING TO CANCEL THE PRINT.
C= C CLEARS THE BUFFER 
ESC  EXIT BUFFER
C= S PRINT SCREEN - THIS COMMAND WILL DUMP WHAT IS CURRENTLY ON THE SCREEN TO        YOUR PRINTER, IF YOU HAVE ONE.  THIS WILL WORK IN TERMINAL MODE AS WELL AS      IN VIEW BUFFER MODE.

C= E TOGGLES LOCAL ECHO ON AND OFF.  LOCAL ECHO WILL ECHO BACK TO YOUR LOCAL    SCREEN WHATEVER INPUT YOU TYPE, THIS IS USEFUL WHEN CONNECTING TO SYSTEMS THAT  DO NOT ECHO BACK CONTENT TO YOUR CLIENT BY DEFAULT (COFFEEMUD.NET IS ONE SUCH   EXAMPLE).  YOU WILL NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS MODE, AS YOUR C128 WILL  SIMPLY PRINT EXACTLY WHAT THE KEY YOU HIT WOULD DO, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE      SERVER MIGHT INTERPRET THAT KEY VALUE AS, THINGS LIKE CHANGING THEY TEXT COLOR  OR MOVING THE CURSOR WILL DO JUST THAT ON YOUR SYSTEM, BUT MAY DO NOTHING OR    SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WHEN SENT TO THE SERVER, SO YOU CAN WIND UP WITH WHAT THE SERVER YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THINKING YOUR SCREEN LOOKS LIKE AND YOUR   LOCAL SCREEN BEING IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STATES. FOR MOST GENERAL USES YOU    WILL LIKELY NEVER NEED TO USE THIS MODE, ONLY IF YOU ARE CONNECTING TO A SERVER THAT DOESN'T ECHO WILL YOU NEED TO USE THIS MODE.  A CAPITAL E WILL APPEAR IN   THE STATUS BAR WHEN THE ECHO IS TURNED ON.  IF YOU ARE SEEING WHAT YOU ARE      TYPING APPEARING TWICE ON THE SCREEN THE MOST LIKELY REASON IS YOU HAVE ECHO    TURNED ON, TURNING IT OFF WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUE.

ABE - ADDRESS BOOK EDITOR
    THIS PROGRAM IS A BASIC PROGRAM TO ALLOW YOU TO EDIT THE ADDRESS BOOK USED  BY KIPPERTERM 128, ITS FAIRLY SELF EXPLANATORY, SO I WON'T GO INTO ANY MORE     DETAIL THAN THAT.

GOPHER MODE 
F1 - SHOW NEXT PAGE                                                             F2 - SHOW HISTORY                                                               F3 - GO BACK A PAGE IN HISTORY                                                  F5 - OPEN NEW SERVER                                                            F7 - SHOW PREVIOUS PAGE
 
    I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE C128 CARTRIDGE PORT CAN BE "NOISY" AND THAT THE   MINI X-PANDER BY ARKANIX LABS CAN HELP WITH LINE NOISE.  AS OF THIS WRITING     THIS PRODUCT IS STILL AVAILABLE ON EBAY.  I CANNOT VOUCH FOR THE VERACITY OF    THE CLAIMS MADE BY THE PRODUCT BUT IF YOU NOTICE EXCESSIVE NOISE/PROBLEMS ON    YOUR 128 USING YOUR NIC CARD, YOU MAY WISH TO CONSIDER IT. I GET NO KICK BACK   FROM THAT PLUG, BUT JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE.
    USE IN GOOD HEALTH AND HAVE FUN.

        SEAN (BADCO)
