<h2>Magic Variables</h2>
The following BASIC variables are set by BASIC ON BAILS whenever a HTTP request is being handled.
<h3>PA$</h3>
Set to the "path" part of the HTTP request.
<h3>Query String Variables</h3>
For each variable in the query string part of the HTTP request,the value is 
decoded and stuck into a BASIC string variable.
<br>
<br>
Only the first letter of the query string variable is significant,
i.e. query strings N, NA, NAME, all would map to N$.
<br>
<br>
If there are multiple query string variables that all start with the
same letter, the LAST such variable in the query string is the one
that would be effective
.e.g if BASIC ON BAILS is processing a HTTP request with a query string /FOO?N=1&NA=2?NAME=3 then
in the BASIC handler, N$ would be "3", and NA$ and NAME$ would be
empty (BASIC only treats first 2 chars as significant anyway, so NA$
is same as NAME$)
<br>
<h2>STARTUP</h2>
If you try and load BASIC ON BAILS twice (or some other BASIC extender before BASIC ON BAILS) you will get an 'insufficient memory' error.
<br>
<br>

After BASIC ON BAILS has been installed, it will attempt to load (and run) a file (from whatever device BASIC ON BAILS was loaded from itself) called "INDEX.BAS". 
If this file does not exist, then BASIC ON BAILS will exit with 'FILE NOT FOUND ERROR IN 10". This error can be ignored - you can load any file you want from then, or type
in a new one, or even use the commands in interactive mode.
<br>
<br>
<h2>ERROR HANDLING</h2>
Before HTTPD is called, BASIC errors are treated normally, i.e. on a SYNTAX ERROR or TYPE MISMATCH error, an error will be displayed on the screen, and 
program execution will stop. But once you have fired up HTTPD, any BASIC errors are displayed on the
screen AND passed back to the browser as a HTTP error, and are non-fatal i.e. the HTTPD loop will keep running. You can exit HTTPD by
pressing RUN/STOP though.
